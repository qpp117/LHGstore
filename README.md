Various applications model problems as dynamic graphs, which need to require rapid updates and run graph algorithms on the updated graph. Furthermore, these dynamic graphs follow a skewed distribution of vertex degrees, where there are a few high-degree vertices and many low-degree vertices. However, existing methods fail to support both graph updates and graph algorithms efficiently. To our knowledge, there is no work to enable ML-based indexes to support graph storage. In this paper, we propose LHGstore, a novel Learned Hierarchical Graph storage framework that leverages learned indexes to store graphs. Specifically, LHGstore employs a two-hierarchical design to effectively improve the throughput of graph updates while ensuring high-performance graph analysis. Moreover, considering real-world dynamic graphs follow skewed vertex degree distribution, LHGstore stores a vertexâ€™s edges in different data structures depending on the degree of that vertex, instead of a ``one-size-fits-all'' design. LHGstore employs simple array-based structures for low-degree vertices to optimize traversal efficiency, whereas for high-degree vertices, it leverages learned indexes to improve update performance. Experimental results show that our proposed graph storage framework outperforms existing graph systems in terms of throughput for transactional workloads and performance for graph algorithms. This study pioneers the integration of ML-based index into graph storage, offering a robust solution for dynamic graph management and analysis.
